It allow you creating your own group with a independent database.

When you finish your mission, just tick it and turn to the next one.

## 3.calculator of your items

Teamwork is the key to success of one battle.

So you will need to arrange your parterners to buy items for each other,by which we can get the ideal items of everyone.When you finish your teamwork,you need to pay your bill to your parterners.

So this app will help a lot in saving time.Just leave it to app and enjoy your time!
